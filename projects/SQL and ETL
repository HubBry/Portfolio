# SQL and ETL Examples

I've been surprised at the robustness of the <a href="https://leetcode.com/">LeetCode platform</a>, and I've got a few examples of the <a href="https://leetcode.com/studyplan/top-sql-50/">SQL 50!</a>

## SQL 50

The SQL 50 is a great collection of challenges that require skill in applying basic joins, select statements, aggregate functions, subqueries, strings... with a whiole host of solutions and guidance available from the very active community.

As I progress through I'll add more, but these were fun so far!

This turned out to be a march of the CTEs! CTEs a re "common table expressions" is a method to define a temporary result set you can refer to later in the query. I switched to using CTEs over Subqueries when my scripts got seriously out of control & hard to read.
Each approach has a specific use case & specific advantages. If you've got a super complicated subquery you need to use a few times, executing it once in a CTE & saving for later can give you a performance boost.

I got a little carried away with the CTEs, here.. and managed to beat over 80% of the other solutions!
