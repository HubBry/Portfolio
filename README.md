I'm a creative and resourceful data engineer, report developer and cybersecurity advisor with a diverse work history looking to provide support for operations integration, and innovation. 

## Objective
I want to keep working with teams to satisfy customer reporting requirements and strive to innovate & recognize efficiencies along the way, and honoring the Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability (the cybersecurity CIA triad) of business intelligence solutions. I especially like to provide solutions for non-profits looking to have their data cleaned, standardized, readied for analysis, and secured.
